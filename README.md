# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Dana is a data journalist, writing articles about the **UFO sigtings information in McMinnville Oregon.**
- Purpose: Put all of the articles and information table on a website so people can search the data themselves, applying multiple filters on city, state, date, country, and shape of the UFOs.

## Results
Before I do any serach, the table with the complete data is present on the webpage.
When I am trying to use the search criteria on this webpage, the **filters work well** for me and the **layout is very clear**. 
1. I first try one filter: *ar* for *state* criteria as below:

3. When I want to apply multiple filters, I can type in other filter bars as below:

The filted table will be filted again by second filters.
Overall the filters work well.

## Summary
- Drawback: The filter is **case sensitative**. If there is any uppercase for the filter keywords, the webpage cannot recognize that.

- Recommendations:
1. **Add a search button and loading response**: If there are tons of data, people cannot recognize whether the filters work or not at a first glance, the search button and loading response can tell the visitors that the webpage received the message and here are the outputs.
2. **Change the filter bar to dropdown menu instead of the type-in bar** : Due to unfamiliar with the available filter keywords, it may take visitors some time to figure out what they can type in. A dropdown menu can address this issue.
